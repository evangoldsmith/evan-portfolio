## **What is it?**

Basketbrain is a logistic regression model built to predict 


## **How does it work?**

Scribe is built on a Django backend and Vue.js frontend. The backend handles the scribe requests and initates the transcription process with Whisper. After transcription is complete, the GPT-4 API is used to summarize the contents of the meeting transcription. The frontend UI allows users to upload meeting recordings and specify where to send the finalized notes (Microsoft Teams or Slack).

## **How can I use it?**

Unfortunately, Scribe is still a closed source software being developed at the UCF CDL. There could be a potential public release in the future.
