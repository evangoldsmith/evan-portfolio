## **What is it?**

This is the portfolio site you're currently on! Here, you'll find my work, skills, and ongoing projects. It's the best way to see what I'm up to and how to reach me if you want to connect. Thanks for stopping by. I also used the development of this site as a chance to test out some new technologies to broaden my web development knowledge. 

## **How does it work?**
With [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern web framework designed for optomized static site generation, I was able to build an efficient, user friendly portfolio that is easy to work on. I use content collections to dynamically create page routes by simply add markdown (.md) files to a project folder. The frontend styling is done in tailwind css. 

## **How can I use it?**

You are currently using it! The repository for the this portfolio is public on Github and you find instructions for running it locally there.
